"0","# using the pre_export data, identify cohorts that reach the

# they are: sex ratio can only be 
# at most, disproportionate at 65:35
# end result includes 29 cohorts - similar to Elisa's data containing 21 cohorts
# may include a cohort number cutoff of 16 (to be similar to Elisa) later on 
# if need be. right now minimum number per cohort is 9.
